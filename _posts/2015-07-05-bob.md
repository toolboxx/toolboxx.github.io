>Bob is a free signal-processing and machine learning toolbox originally developed by the 
Biometrics group at Idiap Research Institute, Switzerland.

>The toolbox is written in a mix of Python and C++ and is designed to be both efficient and 
reduce development time. It is composed of a reasonably large number of packages that implement 
tools for image, audio & video processing, machine learning and pattern recognition.
