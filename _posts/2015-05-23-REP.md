>REP is environment for conducting data-driven research in a consistent and reproducible way. 
It has a unified classifiers wrapper for variety of implementations like TMVA, Sklearn, XGBoost, 
uBoost. It can train classifiers parallely on a cluster. It support of interactive plots.

<!-- more -->

It includes:

+ **Data** provides operations with data
+ **Estimators (classification and regression)** is sklearn-like wrappers for variety of machine learning libraries (Sklearn, uBoost, XGBoost, TMVA). These can be used as base estimators in sklearn.
+ **Meta Machine Learning** contains factory (the set of estimators), grid search, folding algorithm. Also parallel execution on a cluster is supported
+ **Report for models** contains helpful classes to get model result information on any dataset
+ **Plotting** is wrapper for different plotting libraries including interactive plots (matplotlib, bokeh, tmva, plotly)
+ **Utilities** contains additional functions
