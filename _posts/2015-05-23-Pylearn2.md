## Highlights

Pylearn2 was used to set the state of the art on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN. 
See `pylearn2.models.maxout` or `pylearn2/scripts/papers/maxout`.
Pylearn2 provides a wrapper around Alex Krizhevsky's extremely efficient GPU convolutional 
network library. This wrapper lets you use Theano's symbolic differentiation and other capabilities 
with minimal overhead. See `pylearn2.sandbox.cuda_convnet`.
