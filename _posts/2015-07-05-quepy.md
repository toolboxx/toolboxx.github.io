>What's quepy?
Quepy is a python framework to transform natural language questions to queries in a database query language. 
It can be easily customized to different kinds of questions in natural language and database queries. So, 
with little coding you can build your own system for natural language access to your database.
Currently Quepy provides support for Sparql and MQL query languages. We plan to extended it to other database query languages.
