>ZeroMQ (also known as ØMQ, 0MQ, or zmq) looks like an embeddable networking library 
but acts like a concurrency framework. It gives you sockets that carry atomic messages 
across various transports like in-process, inter-process, TCP, and multicast. You can 
connect sockets N-to-N with patterns like fan-out, pub-sub, task distribution, and 
request-reply. It's fast enough to be the fabric for clustered products. Its asynchronous 
I/O model gives you scalable multicore applications, built as asynchronous message-processing 
tasks. It has a score of language APIs and runs on most operating systems. ZeroMQ is from 
iMatix and is LGPLv3 open source.
