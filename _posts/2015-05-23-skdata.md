**skdata** is a library of data sets for machine learning experiments, with modules that:

1. download data sets,
2. load them as directly as possible as Python data structures, and
3. provide protocols for machine learning tasks via convenient views.

What data sets does it provide? [Browse the list of data sets](https://github.com/jaberg/skdata/wiki/Data-Set-Modules).
