>Pylint is a Python source code analyzer which looks for programming errors, helps enforcing a 
coding standard and sniffs for some code smells (as defined in Martin Fowler's Refactoring book).
Pylint has many rules enabled by default, way too much to silence them all on a minimally sized 
program. It's highly configurable and handle pragmas to control it from within your code. Additionally, 
it is possible to write plugins to add your own checks.

It's a free software distributed under the GNU Public Licence.
