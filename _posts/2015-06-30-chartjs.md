>Simple HTML5 Charts using the canvas element chartjs.org

<!-- more -->

Features:

- Six chart types: Visualize your data in 6 different ways. Each of them animated, with a load of customisation options and interactivity extensions.
- HTML5 based: Chart.js uses the HTML5 canvas element. It's supported in all modern browsers, and polyfills support for IE7/8.
- Simple and flexible: Chart.js is dependency free and super lightweight. All six core chart types are only 11.01kb when minified, concatenated and served gzipped.
- Responsive: Chart.js will resize your chart if the browser changes size, along with providing the perfect scale granularity for that size.
- Modular: Chart.js is modular, and each of the chart types have been split up, so you can load only which chart types you need for your project.
- Interactive: Chart.js provides default simple support for canvas tooltips on hover/touch, but you can extend chart interactions to trigger events in your application.
