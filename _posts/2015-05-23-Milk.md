>Milk is a machine learning toolkit in Python. Its focus is on supervised classification with several 
classifiers available: SVMs, k-NN, random forests, decision trees. It also performs feature selection. 
These classifiers can be combined in many ways to form different classification systems. For unsupervised 
learning, milk supports k-means clustering and affinity propagation.

## Features

+ SVMs. Using the libsvm solver with a pythonesque wrapper around it.
+ LASSO
+ K-means using as little memory as possible. It can cluster millions of instances efficiently.
+ Random forests
+ Self organising maps
+ Stepwise Discriminant Analysis for feature selection.
+ Non-negative matrix factorisation
+ Affinity propagation
