>ScalaNLP is the umbrella project for several libraries, including Breeze and Epic. 
Breeze is a set of libraries for machine learning and numerical computing. Epic is a 
high-performance statistical parser and structured prediction library.

## Breeze

Breeze is the core set of libraries for ScalaNLP, including linear algebra, numerical 
computing and optimization. It enables a generic, powerful yet still efficient approach to machine learning.

## Epic

Epic is a powerful, state-of-the-art, statistical parser for eight languages backed by a 
generic framework for building complex systems using structured prediction.

## Puck

Puck is an insanely fast GPU-powered parser, built on the same grammars produced by the 
Berkeley Parser. On a mid-range Nvidia GTX 680, it can parse over 400 sentences a second, 
or over half a million words per minute.
