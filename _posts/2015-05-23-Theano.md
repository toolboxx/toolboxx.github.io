>Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical 
expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. Theano features:

<!-- more -->

+ **tight integration with NumPy** – Use numpy.ndarray in Theano-compiled functions.
+ **transparent use of a GPU** – Perform data-intensive calculations up to 140x faster than with CPU.(float32 only)
+ **efficient symbolic differentiation** – Theano does your derivatives for function with one or many inputs.
+ **speed and stability optimizations** – Get the right answer for log(1+x) even when x is really tiny.
+ **dynamic C code generation** – Evaluate expressions faster.
+ **extensive unit-testing and self-verification** – Detect and diagnose many types of mistake.

Theano has been powering large-scale computationally intensive scientific 
investigations since 2007. But it is also approachable enough to be used in 
the classroom (IFT6266 at the University of Montreal).
