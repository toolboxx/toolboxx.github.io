>The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies. 
Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines, though it does provide 
helpful libraries that can be used to build them. The name "LLVM" itself is not an acronym; it is 
the full name of the project.

>LLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, 
SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary 
programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of 
subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source 
projects as well as being widely used in academic research. Code in the LLVM project is licensed under 
the "UIUC" BSD-Style license.
