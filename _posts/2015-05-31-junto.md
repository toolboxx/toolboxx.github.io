>This toolkit consists of implementations of various graph-based semi-supervised learning 
(SSL) algorithms. Currently, three algorithms are implemented: Gaussian Random Fields (GRF), 
Adsorption, and Modified Adsorption (MAD). Junto also contains Hadoop-based implementations 
of these three algorithms. https://github.com/parthatalukdar/junto

Label propagation is a popular approach to semi-supervised learning in which nodes in a 
graph represent features or instances to be classified and the labels for a classification 
task are pushed around the graph from nodes that have initial label assignments to their 
neighbors and beyond.
