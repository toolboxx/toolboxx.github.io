>Awesome-scala is a community driven list of useful Scala libraries, frameworks and software. 
This is not a catalog of all the libraries, just a starting point for your explorations. 
Inspired by [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python). Other amazingly 
awesome lists can be found in the [awesome-awesomeness](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness) list.
