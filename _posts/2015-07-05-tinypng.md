>TinyPNG uses smart lossy compression techniques to reduce the file size of your PNG files. 
By selectively decreasing the number of colors in the image, fewer bytes are required to store 
the data. The effect is nearly invisible but it makes a very large difference in file size!

## How does it work?

>Excellent question! When you upload a PNG (Portable Network Graphics) file, similar colors in 
your image are combined. This technique is called “quantization”. Because the number of colors 
is reduced, 24-bit PNG files can be converted to much smaller 8-bit indexed color images. All 
unnecessary metadata is stripped too. The result: tiny PNG files with 100% support for transparency. 
Have your cake and eat it too!
