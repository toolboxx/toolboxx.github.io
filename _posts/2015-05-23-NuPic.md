>The Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing (NuPIC) is a machine intelligence 
platform that implements the HTM learning algorithms. HTM is a detailed computational 
theory of the neocortex. At the core of HTM are time-based continuous learning 
algorithms that store and recall spatial and temporal patterns. NuPIC is suited to 
a variety of problems, particularly anomaly detection and prediction of streaming data sources.
