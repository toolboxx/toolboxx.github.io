>WikiReverse shows pages that link to Wikipedia articles. This is sometimes known as a reverse web-link graph.

The source data was the July 2014 web crawl released by Common Crawl, which contains 3.6 billion web pages. 
WikiReverse isn't affiliated with Common Crawl or Wikipedia. But is very grateful to both projects for their 
work supporting open data.
